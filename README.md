#  Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, making early diagnosis extremely important.

This project develops and evaluates multiple **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** models for classifying breast tumors as **Benign** or **Malignant** using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic Dataset.

The notebook explores different SVM kernels, compares their performance with Logistic Regression, performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and evaluates the final model using multiple performance metrics.

#  Key Insights

- Logistic Regression provided a strong baseline classifier.
- Linear SVM improved performance by maximizing the decision margin.
- Polynomial SVM introduced additional complexity but achieved lower accuracy.
- RBF Kernel produced the best balance between flexibility and generalization.
- Hyperparameter tuning confirmed that the default RBF kernel was already close to optimal for this dataset.
